# Azure-media-storage-container

# üìò Media Storage Web App

A simple browser-based solution to upload, view, download, and delete files from Azure Blob Storage using Flask. Supports secure inline viewing of PDFs, images, text, and DOCX files via Microsoft Office Online.

üéØ Project Goals

Build a minimal web app to demonstrate file management using Azure Blob Storage

Enable secure document viewing without downloading files

Support image and PDF inline rendering in-browser

Provide a portable, cloud-based dev environment using GitHub Codespaces

Lay foundation for future improvements like login, search, and tagging

üë• User Stories

As a user, I want to upload documents through a web form so that I can store them in the cloud.

As a user, I want to see a list of all uploaded files so that I can choose which one to download or delete.

As a user, I want to click 'View' on a supported file type and view it in-browser without downloading.

As a user, I want to view .docx files without installing Word by opening them via Office Online.

As a developer, I want to deploy and test the app on GitHub Codespace without local dependencies.

As a developer, I want secure access to Azure Blob Storage using environment variables.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Azure Blob Storage Integration

### Upload File:

```python
blob_client.upload_blob(file, overwrite=True)
```

### Download File:

```python
blob_data = blob_client.download_blob().readall()
```

### Delete File:

```python
blob_client.delete_blob()
```

### View `.docx` Securely:

* Generate short-term SAS URL with `generate_blob_sas()`
* Redirect to:
  `https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=<URL_ENCODED_SAS_LINK>`

## üñºÔ∏è Jinja2 HTML Template: `index.html`

Lists uploaded files and provides action buttons:

```jinja2
{% for blob in blobs %}
    {{ blob.name }}
    <a href="{{ url_for('view_file', filename=blob.name) }}">View</a>
    <a href="{{ url_for('download_file', filename=blob.name) }}">Download</a>
    <a href="{{ url_for('delete_file', filename=blob.name) }}">Delete</a>
{% endfor %}
```
